# Reactive Android Network Snackbar

This purpose of this repository is to demo the `NetworkSnackBarHelper` which is a convenience class for registering a broadcast receiver which can listen for network state changes and display a persistent snackbar. The class will also give callbacks if you wish to delegate the network changes back to a presenter or viewmodel if desired.
